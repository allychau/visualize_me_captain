### Project Proposal
For our project, we plan to track the growth of EV charge stations across the United States with YoY State and National CO2 emissions data. 

### Background
Rising average global temperatures since pre-industrial times are threatening current livelihoods. Some of the consequences of rising temperatures include rising sea-levels, climate migration, amplified natural disasters, food/water shortages, and increased probability of disease spread. One way to combat/mitigate the impacts of climate change is to shift transportation medium to electric power from fossil-fuel power. While this change in itself is not a complete solution to climate change, nor is not possible to perform overnight, it nonetheless remains a key element in a holistic approach to fighting climate change. This repository sources, tracks, and analyzes data from EIA, Kaggle to quantify the rise in temperatures and how that has influenced the rise of EV infrastructure, specifically the number of charge stations that have been installed across the states within the United States.
